  

Scheme of testing('Win' or 'Draw')

1. Random choice of 9 buttons for clicking(next step of cycle - 8 buttons,7 and so on till 1)

2. Clicking this button and reading the text
   inside this button('X' || 'O', f.ex.'X')

3. My checking: is there a Winner?('XXX' || 'OOO', depends on last move f.ex.'XXX') -
   searching for 1 of 8   combinations  having 'XXX'
   using Array of winning triple-array index combinations(f.ex.[0,3,6])

    3a. If Yes, we have 'Winner: X'(there is such a combination, f.ex.'XXX'),
        so then checking if game is really OVER? For this we check:
        1.is there headline 'Winner: X'?
        2.nothing is changed if trying to click any button

    3b. If 'No Winner' and there is no empty button for next move,
           so we have 'Draw'  and  checking if game is really OVER?For this we check:
         1.is there headline  'Draw'
         2.nothing is changed if trying to click any button (edited) 

    3c. If 'No Winner' and there is  minimum one empty button for next move, so test goes to p.1
